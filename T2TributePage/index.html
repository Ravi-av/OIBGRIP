                Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who Founded X.com in 1999 (which later became
                PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his
                start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a
                rocket that would send the first commercial adfvehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio
                with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role
                in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration. In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as
                the wealthiest man in the world.<p><br>
                In 1983 he created a video game and sold it for 500$
                At the age of 14, Elon decided that his life mission is to save humanity
                In 1989, he started college in Ontario
                In 1994, he got Wharton economics and physics degrees
                After that he worked two intern jobs and brainstormed ideas
                He left Stanford PhD after 2 days
                In 1995, Musk starts Zip2 with his brother, coding it himself
                After sleeping in the office for 3 months, he raised his first investment money (3M), and later sold his share for $22 Million
                In 1999, he starts X.com - an online bank with his own money
                In 2000, he merges with his rival start-up Confinity to form PayPal
                Later that same year, he got ousted from PayPal as a CEO (while on honeymoon). Regardless of that, Musk continues to invest money in it
                In 2001, Elon moved to LA to be closer to the space industry and learned how to build rockets from books
                In 2002, after finding out that rockets are overpriced, the ambitious entrepreneur started Space X and got 250M from sale of PayPal
                In 2004, he founded likeminded people and started his venture into electric cars - TESLA
                In 2006, his first rocket was launched and exploded. Moreover, he won a NASA contracts to demo delivery and became the first investor of Solar City - his cousin's company
                In 2007, his second rocket was launched... and exploded again
                In 2008, the first TESLA customers got their Roadsters at $109,000. What is more, another failed attempt at launching a rocket brought both TESLA and Space X to the crisis of running out of money. However, his fourth launch turned successful which won him a NASA contract for 12 flights for $1,6 Billion. In december 2008, hours before going bankrupt, Elon found funding for TESLA.
                In 2009, Musk unveiled the Model S car
                In 2010, TESLA went public at 17$ per share, ending at $24 by the end of the day
                In 2011, Elon announced the project for reusable rockets, which would make flights 100 times cheaper. This was also the year in which Musk promised to send humans to Mars by 2031
                In 2012, the shipping for Model S begins while the Model X is unveiled and a supercharger network for the cars was launched
                In 2014, he started building the Gigafacory to mass produce batteries
                In 2015, Musk unveiled Powerwall, first customers got their Model X. However, there was also a failed launch of a rocket (after 19 successful launches) but also a successul landing of the first reusable rocket to reach orbit.
                In 2017, he started the Boring Company to dig tunnels, two new cars were uvailed - TESlA Roadster and and the Semi Electric Truc and first customers got their Model 3.
